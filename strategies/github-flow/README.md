# GitHub Flow

A simpler, continuous delivery-focused strategy where all branches are based on main, and all branches are merged back into main after development and testing are complete.

## Main Branches

- **`main` (or `master`)**
  - Always contains **production-ready** code.
  - Tagged with release versions (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

- **`develop`**
  - Integration branch for all completed features.
  - Reflects the latest delivered development changes.

## Supporting Branches

### `feature/*`

- Branched from: `develop`
- Purpose: New features or enhancements
- Merged into: `develop`
- Deleted after merge

### `release/*`

- Branched from: `develop`
- Purpose: Final pre-release stabilization (e.g., version bumping, final testing)
- Merged into: `main` and `develop`
- Tagged with release version (on `main`)
- Deleted after merge

### `hotfix/*`

- Branched from: `main`
- Purpose: Urgent fixes in production
- Merged into: `main` and `develop`
- Tagged with patch version (on `main`)
- Deleted after merge

### `bugfix/*` (optional)

- Branched from: `develop` or `release/*`
- Purpose: Fix non-critical bugs
- Merged into: source branch

## ðŸ”„ GitFlow Workflow Summary

```text
develop     â†’ feature/*
develop     â†’ release/*
main        â†’ hotfix/*
release/*   â†’ main + develop
hotfix/*    â†’ main + develop
```

## Pros

- Clear separation of concerns.
- Supports parallel development and multiple releases.
- Formalizes versioning and release cycles.

## Cons

- More complex than simpler models (e.g., trunk-based).
-- Can be heavyweight for small teams or continuous deployment.

> Pro Tip: Use GitFlow extensions (e.g., git flow init) or GitHub workflows to automate parts of the process.
