# Trunk-Based Development

This approach involves all developers working on a single branch (the "trunk" or main), with short-lived feature branches merged in quickly. This emphasizes frequent integration and reduces the complexity of managing multiple long-lived branches.

## Core Concepts

- **Trunk (`main` or `master`)**
  - The single source of truth.
  - Always stable, always deployable.
  - Developers commit or merge changes directly (or via short-lived branches).

- **Short-Lived Branches**
  - Optional.
  - Feature branches last hours or at most a day or two.
  - Frequently merged back into `main`.

- **Feature Flags**
  - Used to hide incomplete features in `main` without branching.
  - Enables safe, continuous deployment.

- **Continuous Integration**
  - Frequent (often multiple times per day) integration into `main`.
  - Automated tests validate every commit or merge.

## Key Practices

- Keep branches small and merge often.
- Use automated tests and CI pipelines to validate changes.
- Collaborate through code reviews, even on small changes.
- Avoid long-lived branches or forks.

## Benefits

- **Fast Feedback:** Issues are identified early.
- **Simplified Merges:** Less merge debt and fewer conflicts.
- **High Release Velocity:** Enables continuous delivery.
- **Better Collaboration:** Everyone works off the same version.

## Challenges

- Requires a strong CI/CD pipeline.
- Discipline needed to avoid breaking `main`.
- May require **feature flags**, **toggle frameworks**, or **incremental delivery techniques**.

> Pro Tip: Set up branch protection and CI checks to keep `main` clean and production-ready.
